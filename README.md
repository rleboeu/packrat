## Description
Tired of all that cobblestone clogging your inventory? Packrat has you covered.
Packrat is a per-player loot management Bukkit plugin that uses the Spigot API. Simply type `nopickup cobblestone` and mine away!

## Commands
- nopickup [item:hand] [^1]
- pickup [item:hand] [^1]
- pickupall
- pickupnone
- pickupshow
[^1]: The `item` flag is the name of the material/item, not the numerical item ID. Typing `nopickup hand` will disable looting on the item currently in the player's hand.
